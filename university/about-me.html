    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Kenny and I am a third year stuyding at the
        University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am double majoring in
        <a href="./data-science.html">Data Science</a> and
        <a href="./math.html">Applied Mathematics - Numerical and
            Applied Analysis.</a>
        <br><br>
        I am doing this project over winter break to prepare me for
        <a href="https://eecs485staff.github.io/eecs485.org/">
            EECS 485 - Web Systems.</a>
        I have taken an interest in data visualizations, and I figured
        that web development is a fantastic way to broaden my
        tools in creating visuals in a unique way.
