    <p>This is a ranking of my favorite study spots on campus.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The Michigan Union</strong>
            <br>
            <img src=https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/fetch/c_limit,q_75,w_1200/https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/annarbor/UnionBldg16-036--78a62dcc5056a36_78a63236-5056-a36a-06d304f7206dcfb8.jpg

            The basement level is my go-to spot. The food court consists of Panda Express,
            Subway, Michigan Burger, and Blue Market. There is supposedly massage chairs near
            CAPS office on the fourth floor, but I have never been there before.
            It is a common and one of the popular work spaces on campus so it does get full
            during peak hours.

            <strong>Michigan League - Basement Floor</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/fetch/c_limit,q_75,w_1200/https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/annarbor/MichLeague17-006--78af41105056a36_78af437c-5056-a36a-06e7519d569e4615.jpg"

            Despite its old historic interior, the basement has much of a more modern look. The tables and booths are much
            more spread out and this place is not really known to the public compared to the other places on this list,
            making this place more preferrable for a quiet but not dead quiet place to do work in.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Shapiro Undergraduate Library</strong>
            <br>
            <img src="https://universityofmichigan.myuvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2015/02/lobby.jpg"

            <br>
            A little farther from where I live, but it's a good spot. I prefer the first floor study room because
            there are many people and is more lively compared to the third and fourth floor, which is traditionally
            for quiet spots. The bathroom can be terribly disgusting here, so that's why it didn't make it high on the list.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Fish Bowl</strong>
            <br>

            <br>
            Honestly, not one of my favorite places to work at but if I really need a place to go then
            this would be my last resort. Don't know why I don't like this place but the vibes just isn't right for me.
