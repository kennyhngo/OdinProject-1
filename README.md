# Pre Write Up
This project is assigned to test my skills of HTML.

This project will primarily focus on the basic foundations of creating:
* headers
* paragraphs
* links
* images
* unordered and ordered lists
  
Because CSS has not been introduced, this will be the barebones of the website with no pretty visuals and formatting.

I have little to no recipe knowledge, so this project is not the one presenting on the website. Instead of recipes, I will be writing about my univeristy - University of Michigan - and come up with some topic that would require me to rank some stuff about the university.

# Post Write Up
Instead of creating a project on recipes as the original creators of the project wanted me to do, I instead decided
to personalize the project a bit and created a website about my study spots at my university's campus and a page
about who I am.

Project reflection: The goal of this project has been met - with the usage of headers, paragraphs, links, images,
and lists.
