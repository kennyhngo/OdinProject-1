# Pre Write Up
This project is assigned to test my skills of HTML.

This project will primarily focus on the basic foundations of creating:
* headers
* paragraphs
* links
* images
* unordered and ordered lists
  
Because CSS has not been introduced, this will be the barebones of the website with no pretty visuals and formatting.

I have little to no recipe knowledge, so this project is not the one presenting on the website. Instead of recipes, I will be writing about my univeristy - University of Michigan - and come up with some topic that would require me to rank some stuff about the university.
